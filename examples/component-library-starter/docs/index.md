# What is My Lib?

This library is a starter to create your own Vue 3 component library in TypeScript.

There are two example components included for you to get started with creating your own
components:

- [ComponentA](/components/component-a) is a simple Hello World component with icon from
  bundled font file.
- [ComponentB](/components/component-b) is a counter component using button from
  [PrimeVue](https://www.primefaces.org/primevue/), icons from
  [PrimeIcons](https://www.primefaces.org/showcase/icons.xhtml) and styling from
  [PrimeFlex](https://www.primefaces.org/primeflex/).
